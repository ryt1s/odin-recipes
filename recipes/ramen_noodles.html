    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 (3 ounce) packages dry ramen noodles, seasoning packets discarded
      </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili oil (optional)</li>
      <li>
        thinly sliced green onions and sesame seeds for garnish (optional)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a pot with 5 cups of water and bring to a boil. Add ramen noodles
        to the boiling water, and cook until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain
        noodles, reserving some of the noodle water in case you need to thin out
        the sauce later. Add drained noodles back to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, whisk miso paste, butter, soy sauce, and rice vinegar
        together in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over the hot noodles, and
        stir until well combined. The hot noodles will soak up the sauce, so add
        some reserved cooking water if sauce needs to be thinned out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evenly divide the noodles among 3 bowls. Drizzle each with chili oil and
        garnish with thinly sliced green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds
        before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
